        <span style="font-size: 50px;">the history of the ford fusion</span>
        <p>Ford did not start production of the Fusion until August 1, 2005. Which means the Fusion's very first year of the model was 2006. Production for the first model began in Mexico.</p>

        <p>In 2007, Fusions had AWD on the V6 models. Sirius XM Radio also became a "thing" on the 2007 models. There was also a lot of things that the radio had regarding features.</p>

        <p>The 2007 model had different trim levels to choose from: S, SE or SEL.</p>

        <p>In 2010, the design of the Fusion completely changed.</p>

        <p>In 2013, the design of the car changed once again.</p>

        <p>If you notice, the design of the Fusion changed every three years.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Ford announced they will no longer be producing the Fusion as a sedan, four door vehicle.</p>

        <p>The 2021 model year is the last year of the car.</p>
